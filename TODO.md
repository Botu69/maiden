## critical

* refresh file tree after fs modifications (retaining tree visibility state)
* error checking on install, update, delete response
* confirmation dialog on project remove
* show indeterminant progress indicator during above operations (with timeout)
* copy catalog entry to dotfile in project dir to carry over catalog metadata
* project read logic should load metadata from above dotfile
* tool tips on controls
* expose catalog update control
* manual project add dialog (just paste in a link)
* consistently sort catalogs in available view (catalog entries are already sorted)
* update/remove project when update or delete operation completes in project view

## nice to have

* lines discussion links
* disable install button for projects already installed?
* fix offset select border on installed/available control
* project update for unmanaged project should pull from the same catalog
* fix project info/control spacing differences between installed vs available views
* allow editing of .json files in maiden so the catalogs can be tweaked directly
* support collapsing catalog with a double-click in available view
